# Impact-of-funding-and-funding-rounds-on-Startups
Using Hypothesis Testing to determine whether there is any impact of funding and funding rounds on startup survival.
Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing:
Led the formulation of clear and testable hypotheses, focusing on mean funds raised and the number of funding rounds to understand significant differences between currently operating startups and those that have closed.
Applied statistical tests including the independent sample t-test for mean funds raised and the Chi-Square Test of Independence for funding rounds, utilizing tools such as Python (or relevant programming language) for robust analysis.

Data Exploration and Validation:
Conducted a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, ensuring data quality and coherence.
Employed data visualization techniques to gain deeper insights into the funding patterns and startup statuses, facilitating a more informed hypothesis formulation.
Impactful Insights and Conclusions:

Successfully identified and presented statistically sound conclusions based on the results of hypothesis testing.
Communicated actionable insights regarding the relationship between funding, funding rounds, and startup survival, contributing to a deeper understanding of financial factors differentiating thriving startups from those that cease operations.


Demonstrated proficiency in using statistical tools and programming languages such as Python (or relevant tools) for data analysis, hypothesis testing, and visualization.
Employed domain-specific knowledge to strategically choose appropriate statistical tests, ensuring the validity and reliability of the analysis.
